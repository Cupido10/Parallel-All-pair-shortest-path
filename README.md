# Parallel-All-pair-shortest-path
Using MPI to implement APSP. 
Each process control one vertice and communicate with other process.

## Key:

1. MPI_Graph_create
2. MPI_Graph_neighbors 
3. MPI_Graph_neighbors_count
4. MPI_Allreduce

These four above are the most important functions to implement APSP easily.
Try to Google it!!
